I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in energy-efficient heterogeneous systems for embedded machine learning (ML) from MICAS laboratories, KU Leuven under the supervision of Prof. Marian Verhelst. I was also a Visiting Researcher with the IIS Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland, in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Luca Benini and working on the design of high-performance network-on-chips for DNN platforms. Before my PhD, I received my M.Sc. degree in embedded electronics systems design (EESD) from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2018 ad my B.Tech degree from Sathyabama University, India. I have published several papers and posters in top conferences and journals such as ISSCC, JSSC, Sym. on VLSI Technology and Circuits, TCAS-I and TComp. I also serve as a reviewer for the IEEE Transaction on Very Larse Scale Integration Systems (TVLSI) and IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I (TCAS-I).

I received the Prestigious Research Fellowship from the Swedish Institute (SI) for 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 during my master’s program. I have also received the Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Predoctoral Achievement Award for 2022-2023, the SSCS Student Travel Grant in 2022, and the Lars Pareto Travel Grant in 2019.
