I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in SpeciaLIzed Computing Ecosystem (SLICE) Lab and Berkeley Wireless Research Center (BWRC) of the University of California, Berkeley, under the guidance of Prof. Borivoje Nikolic and Prof. Sophia Shao. My current research is in the field of heterogeneous integration and chiplet (2.5 and 3D) architectures for emerging high-performance computing and AI applications. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in energy-efficient heterogeneous systems for embedded machine learning (ML) from MICAS laboratories, KU Leuven under the supervision of Prof. Marian Verhelst. I was also a Visiting Researcher, during my Ph.D., with the IIS Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Luca Benini and working on the design of high-performance networks-on-chip for DNN platforms.

I have published several papers and posters in top conferences and journals such as ISSCC, JSSC, Sym. on VLSI Technology and Circuits (VLSI), DAC, DATE, TCAS-I, TVLSI, and TComp. I also serve as a reviewer for the IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits, IEEE Transaction on Very Large Scale Integration Systems (TVLSI), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I (TCAS-I), and IEEE Internet-of-Things Journal (IoTJ).

I have received the Solid-State Circuits Society (SSCS) Predoctoral Achievement Award for 2022-2023, the SSCS Student Travel Grant in 2022, and the Lars Pareto Travel Grant in 2019. I also received a prestigious research fellowship from the Swedish Institute (SI) for 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 during my master’s program. 

Before my Ph.D., I received my M.Sc. degree in embedded electronics systems design (EESD) from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2018, and my B.Tech degree (silver medal) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Sathyabama University, India.
